## 🧠 Inspiration 
Habits. They're easy to follow but tough to get rid off.

Good, healthy habits help lay the groundwork for a healthy lifestyle - something the younger generations to come will struggle with due to screen time from work & gaming, long periods of inactivity and fast food which has cemented itself into our modern culture. We believe that the best approach to developing good healthy habits is to first purge any current unhealthy ones.

So when it comes to getting rid of old unhealthy habits, positive reinforcement hasn't always worked for some of us. Sometimes the thing you need most to quit your old habits isn't some kind words or motivation, but instead some understanding of the consequences of sticking to old, unhealthy habits. Like a strict couch over a mediocre one, we desire an app that is intuitive, simple yet effective at encouraging us to stay healthy.

## 🤓 How we built it
The technologies used for this project are:

**Frontend**:
* ReactJS
* TailwindCSS
* TailwindUI

**Backend**:
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS

## 👾 Challenges we ran into
* sync the achievements with notifications & dashboard habits syncing with the achievements page
* thinking of ways to integrate AI
* Ensuring that we achieved our goal of utilising negative reinforcement, while not excessively degrading or offending the user

## 😎 Accomplishments that we're proud of
* worked together as a team to get a complete project in less than 2 days
* learnt new concepts and applied them quickly under time-constraint
* had an AI feature part of the complete project

## 📝 What we learned
* openAI API is actually really intuitive and well-made
* everyone had a fun time implementing tailwindCSS with tailwindUI
* learnt ReactJS for frontend dev

## ☀️ What's next for CleanSlate
* add more AI features and develop dedicated features for healthy habits like a meditation feature where AI generates a script and reads it for the guided meditation session. Diet tracking, etc.
